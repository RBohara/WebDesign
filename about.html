                    <p>
                        CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.
                        We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available on Services section) as well.</p>
                    <p> It's the good news for the party monsters especially for teenagers       because on the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay       Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17     and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic         drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm.         There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and         dancing is common (but not required).

                   <p>We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about:    this month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar.      First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry. If you get a         costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear           that costume. Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you        can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them you’ve been to    CossiePlay!

                    <h1>Party Guidelines</h1>
                    <p>
                    CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.<br>
                    Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge.
                    Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer. If you agree to the guidelines, go and hit the sign up button.</p>
