                   <h1>What is CosPlay?</h1>
                   <p>
                       Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. <br>
                       Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series. To learn more, please click

               <h1>Party Guidelines</h1>
                <p>
                    CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.<br>
                    Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge.
                    Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer. If you agree to the guidelines, go and hit the sign up button.
